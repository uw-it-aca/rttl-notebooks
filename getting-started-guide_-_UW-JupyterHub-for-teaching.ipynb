    "## What is Jupyter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is a powerful open source tool designed to support interactive documents (the \"notebook\") with text, visualizations, live code, code outputs, and many other elements displayed inline. The JupyterHub for Teaching service at the UW makes a hosted Jupyter Notebook environment available for UW courses, and requires only a browser to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='components'></a>\n",
    "## UW JupyterHub for Teaching components\n",
    "- **JupyterHub**: software which manages a group of Notebooks, and provides UW NetID login and shared features, as well as management features for instructors.\n",
    "- **Jupyter Notebook environment**: software provided by [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) which can be run on your own computer or on a hosted server (such as the one you're in now). In a hosted environment, you have access not only to the features provided by the Jupyter Notebook software, but also some of the capabilities of the underlying Linux operating system. The environment has installed software and packages selected by the course instructor and is fully configured. This environment is only running while you are using it, and will shut down after a period of inactivity. Depending on your environment, additional software may be available, such as RStudio. You can interact with the underlying operating system by going to \"File > New > Terminal\" in the menu bar.\n",
    "- **JupyterLab**: this is the software responsible for the user interface part of the Notebook. Theme changes can be made by going to settings > theme. Depending on the environment you are using, other interfaces may be available. Check out [the documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/interface.html#:~:text=The%20JupyterLab%20interface%20consists%20of,inspector%2C%20and%20the%20tabs%20list.) for detailed information about the JupyterLab UI.\n",
    "- **Jupyter notebook document**: a structured file ending with the '.ipynb' extension which contains marked up elements that the Jupyter software can interpret and display. There can be many documents on your server, and they can be upload, downloaded, shared, and exported. Start a new Notebook by going to \"File > New > Notebook\" in the menu bar. Upload a Notebook by dragging and dropping an .ipynb file from your computer into the files pane on the left side, or by clicking on the upload icon a the top of the files pane.\n",
    "- **Jupyter kernel**: the live code portions of a document will be run in a programming language such as Python or R, and the kernel is the part of the environment that actually runs that code. Your environment may have more than one kernel installed, and which language is being used is determined when you create a new notebook or by clicking on the kernel name in the top right corner of this pane. Additional kernel features can be accessed by clicking \"Kernel\" on the menu bar.\n",
    "- **Home directory**: this hosted environment is designed to always start from the same state, so changes made to operating system or installed software will be reverted the next time you start up a session. The sole exception to this is your home directory, which is the root of the file system as displayed within the Jupyter environment. Files saved to this location will persist for the acadmic quarter, plus a retention period after the quarter is over.\n"
