Hello from the Hub NFS server!

This folder is a separate volume that can be read and written to by any notebook in this Hub, so do not put sensitive information here, and be careful not to overwrite or delete another user's work. 

Suggested usage patterns: name folders clearly to communicate intent, eg 'shared_datasets', 'my_netid', 'team1_collab'. Add READMEs as appropriate to clarify the intended uses.

Data on this hub is subject to the same availability and retention policies as user data in /home/jovyan.
